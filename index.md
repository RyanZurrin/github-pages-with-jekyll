#Ryan Zurrin's <Blog> on </Bloging>

Well this will actually be my third blog site really. My first and main site is ryanzurrin.com. I then created a wordpress site wich has  a 
Essay blog which is going to be all my writing work and research while Im going through college as a computer science major. The first blog site under my own domain hosted by weebly at the moment is going to be about the learning process and my general experience in school coming from a house painter to CIS major is quite the change and I really feel that documenting the experience should be interesting and possibly even inspiring to anyone that is maybe a little older and affraid to make that leap into something serious. So them are those two and now I'm here trying to learn how to use this awesome site and UI to manage a flow in real time and hopefully Ill be learning how to contibute to real projects soon here. Just dont want to get too far ahead of myself seems I am not really a good coder yet I'd probably end up doing more harm if I even attempted to add my own stuff now so my intentions are to make this blog about my learning process into the realm of Git. So git ready and git learning, Ryan Zurrin's Blog on Blogging is about to Hit and if you wanted a fully recursive experience then you have come to the right pleace because as the title states this blog is all about recursion and how its used all around us from the stretching of time throughout the universe to the spinning of atoms that make up the cells in your body. It all is able to exist because of recursion. How do I think you say? Well i am glad you asked, and we shall surely get there in due time of course but let us first discus the purpose of a blog.
